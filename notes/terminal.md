Terminal:
---
**To make it pretty:**  
	1.	install homebrew  
	2.	install zsh  
	3.	install oh-my-zsh  
  
---
  
**Navigate, move around in the terminal:**  

change directory:
	
	cd
    
list the files in current directory:

	ls

list the files in this whatever directory:

	ls /User/admin/Documents
    
where exactly am I?  
	
	pwd
  
---
  
**Add, remove, edit files:**    
  
create new empty file:
	
	open filename

open folder or file:

	mkdir foldername
    
make a new folder:

	mkdir foldername
	
delete an empty folder or file:

	rm filename
    
delete a folder and everything inside it:  

	rm -rf foldername
    
---
    
**Fix a stubborn filename with spaces:**

add backslash before the space, to tell terminal that it is a character, and not a programmatic separator
